# Developing-TIC-TAC-TOE-using-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms.
We successfully developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporating various AI algorithms. Our approach involved implementing algorithms such as Minimax and Q-Learning, aiming to enhance the AI player's decision-making process To assess their efficiency, we conducted a comparative analysis, exploring factors like computational complexity and decision accuracy. Additionally, we considered the performance of different algorithms in practical gameplay scenarios, evaluating aspects like user experience and strategic depth. After thorough examination, we concluded by identifying the most suitable algorithm for our Tic-Tac-Toe AI, balancing computational efficiency and a challenging gaming experience.
